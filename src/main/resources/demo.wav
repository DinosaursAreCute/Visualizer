This is a placeholder for demo.wav file.

In a real implementation, this would be a WAV audio file for demonstration purposes.
You can replace this file with any WAV audio file for testing the visualizer.

The application will generate sample visualization data if this file is not a valid WAV file.

Suggested demo files:
- A simple sine wave tone
- A short musical excerpt
- Any WAV file you'd like to visualize

To use your own audio file, simply replace this file with a WAV file named "demo.wav"
or run the application with a command-line argument pointing to your audio file.
